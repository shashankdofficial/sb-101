Layered Architecture in Business application:-
==============================================


1. maintaining the business data in secure and easily retrieval manner.

-> the logic that we write to implement this part of business application is known as Data Accees Logic.

2. processing the data according to the business rule .

-> the logic that we write to implement this part of business application is known as Business/Service logic.

3. presenting the data to the user in user-understandable format.

-> the logic that we write to implement this part of business application is known as Presentation logic.


-> the above 3 logics is required for almost every business application.


Note:- we can write all the 3 logics to develop a business application in one program/class itself , if we do so, the following problem we will face:-

1.all the logics to develop the application will be mixed up with each other (no clear code seperation).

2.modification done in one logic may affect the other logic .

3. logics will depend upon each other so, parallel development will not be possible.

4.testing each logic is also will become complex..


-> to solve this problem,  a java based business application ,we divide into 3 logical partition .

and each part we say as a layer:-

1.Presentation Layer(UI layer)

2.Business Logic Layer (Service layer)

3.Data Access Layer 


-> a business application will be divided into the logical partition depending upon the role played by each part.

-> logical partition of a business application is known as layer.


Presentation Layer :- 
=====================

-> it is set of java classes, which are responsible for generating user input screen and response page(output screen) is knwon as PL.

-> this layer provides the interaction with the end-user.


Business Logic Layer/Service Layer:-
===================================

-> programatical implementation of business rule of a business organization is nothing but business logic .
--a collection of java classes whose methods have business logic to process the data according to the business rule is known as SL/BLL.


Data Access Layer :-
=================

-> a set of java classes whose methods r exclusively meant for performing CRUD operation with the DB server is known as DAL.
